#3.1 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using
#input to compute gross pay.

#Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for
#all hours worked above 40 hours.

#Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program
#(the pay should be 498.75).

#You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string
#to a number.

#Do not worry about error checking
#the user input - assume the user types numbers properly.

hrs = input('Enter the Hours:') #Enter the hours i.e 45
try: #Try to enter the interger value and hence h will convert that into float
    h = float(hrs)
except:
    print('Error - Try enter numeric variable') #if not int() it will give Error
rate = input('Enter the rate:') #Enter a rate i.e 10.50
try:
    r = float(rate) #Rate as int()
except:
    print('Error - Try enter numeric variable') #Ow it will give an error

if h > 40 :
    #print overtime
    reg = h*r
    otp = (h-40) * (r*0.5)
    xp = reg + otp
else:
    xp = h*r

print(xp)
